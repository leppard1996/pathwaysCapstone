My first feature is a city comparison tool that allows users to view the weather for one city, then compare it with another city's weather by entering a second location. The feature is activated only after retrieving the first city's weather, and then it dynamically updates and displays the button to be able to compare. Once the button is clicked the user can input the second city, and the second city's temperature, humidity, precipitation, and conditions display in a new section. If the same city is entered twice, the app alerts the user to enter a different location. Currently, the comparison displays vertically, and future improvements could include side-by-side formatting or chart-based visual comparisons.
