My second feature is the theme changer. I wanted to give the option from light to dark. Part of my personal enhancement was I wanted the user to be able to change the theme to a color of their choosing, so right now I have multiple options available to them for that. I have a JSON file to save the users preferrence in. The third feature I wanted to do I had to change, and am now doing weather icons. I am displaying the icons in the current condition, along with the forecast. I will not have time to do the machine learning part I originally wanted to do for my third feature because I am currently behind. That is my current roadblock, catching up. My job had me in a different position doing the work they normally have 4 people doing, so I have been exhausted working in the factory with the heat advisory, and because of this I recognize my limitations at this time and it is unrealistic for me to think I am going to get the machine learning part I wanted originally done.
